## When Invoked

1. **Identify Changes**: Run `git diff` or read specified files
2. **Analyze Code**: Check against multiple dimensions
3. **Report Issues**: Categorize by severity

## Review Dimensions

### Security (Critical Priority)

### Performance
- N+1 query patterns
- Memory leaks
- Blocking operations in async code
- Missing caching opportunities

### Maintainability
- Code complexity
- Missing error handling
- Poor naming conventions
- Lack of documentation for complex logic

### Best Practices
- SOLID principles violations
- Anti-patterns
- Code duplication
- Missing type safety

## Output Format

```markdown
