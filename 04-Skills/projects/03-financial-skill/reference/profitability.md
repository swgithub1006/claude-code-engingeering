# Profitability Analysis Reference

## Margin Metrics

### Gross Profit Margin
```
Gross Margin = (Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue × 100%
```

**Industry Benchmarks:**
| Industry | Typical Range |
|----------|--------------|
| Software/SaaS | 70-85% |
| Retail | 20-50% |
| Manufacturing | 25-35% |
| Services | 50-70% |

### Operating Profit Margin
```
Operating Margin = Operating Income / Revenue × 100%

Operating Income = Revenue - COGS - Operating Expenses
```

### Net Profit Margin
```
Net Margin = Net Income / Revenue × 100%

Net Income = Revenue - All Expenses - Taxes
```

### EBITDA Margin
```
EBITDA Margin = EBITDA / Revenue × 100%

EBITDA = Net Income + Interest + Taxes + Depreciation + Amortization
```

## Return Metrics

### Return on Investment (ROI)
```
ROI = (Gain from Investment - Cost of Investment) / Cost of Investment × 100%
```

### Return on Assets (ROA)
```
ROA = Net Income / Total Assets × 100%
```

**Benchmarks:**
- > 10%: Excellent
- 5-10%: Good
- < 5%: Below average

### Return on Equity (ROE)
```
ROE = Net Income / Shareholders' Equity × 100%
```

**Benchmarks:**
- > 15%: Excellent
- 10-15%: Good
- < 10%: Below average

### DuPont Analysis (ROE Decomposition)
```
ROE = Net Margin × Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier

Where:
- Net Margin = Net Income / Revenue
- Asset Turnover = Revenue / Total Assets
- Equity Multiplier = Total Assets / Shareholders' Equity
```

## Profitability Red Flags

1. **Gross margin declining** while revenue grows (pricing pressure)
2. **Operating margin < 0** (not operationally profitable)
3. **ROE significantly higher than ROA** (high leverage risk)
4. **Net margin < industry average** for 3+ years
5. **EBITDA positive but Net Income negative** (high interest/depreciation burden)
