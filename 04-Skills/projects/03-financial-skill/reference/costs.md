# Cost Analysis Reference

## Cost Categories

### Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
Direct costs attributable to the production of goods sold.

```
COGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory
```

Components:
- Raw materials
- Direct labor
- Manufacturing overhead

### Operating Expenses (OPEX)
Ongoing costs for running a business.

Categories:
- **Sales & Marketing**: Advertising, sales commissions, marketing staff
- **General & Administrative**: Office rent, utilities, administrative staff
- **Research & Development**: Product development, engineering

## Cost Metrics

### Cost Ratio
```
Cost Ratio = Total Costs / Revenue × 100%
```

### Cost per Unit
```
Cost per Unit = Total Production Cost / Units Produced
```

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
```
CAC = Total Sales & Marketing Spend / Number of New Customers
```

### Lifetime Value to CAC Ratio (LTV:CAC)
```
LTV:CAC = Customer Lifetime Value / Customer Acquisition Cost
```

**Benchmarks:**
- LTV:CAC > 3:1 = Healthy
- LTV:CAC < 1:1 = Losing money on customers

## Cost Efficiency Metrics

### Operating Expense Ratio
```
OPEX Ratio = Operating Expenses / Revenue × 100%
```

### Sales Efficiency
```
Sales Efficiency = New ARR / Sales & Marketing Spend
```

## Red Flags

1. **COGS growing faster than revenue** (margin compression)
2. **CAC > LTV** (unsustainable growth)
3. **OPEX ratio increasing** while revenue flat
4. **Inventory costs rising** without corresponding sales
