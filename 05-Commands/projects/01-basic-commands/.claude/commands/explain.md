Explain the following code or concept: $ARGUMENTS

## Explanation Style

Use the "teach a friend" approach:

1. **Start Simple**: One sentence summary of what it does
2. **Break It Down**: Step through the logic
3. **Use Analogies**: Compare to everyday concepts when helpful
4. **Highlight Key Parts**: Point out the important bits

## Output Format

```markdown
## What It Does
[One sentence summary]

## How It Works

### Step by Step
1. First, [what happens first]
2. Then, [what happens next]
...

### Key Concepts
- **[concept]**: [explanation]

## Example
[Simple example if helpful]

## Remember
[The one thing to take away]
```

## Guidelines

- Assume the reader is learning
- Avoid jargon, or define it when used
- Use code examples when they clarify
- Keep it concise but complete
- If explaining a file, focus on the most important parts
